## FlameMaker

*A Java applet about creating Fractals*

#### Description

FlameMaker is a small Java project that was made as part of the EPFL course "Introduction to Object Oriented Programmation". It allows you to create and visualize [Flame Fractals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame) using an algorithm of chaos. 

The \[Original\] version is what every team was asked to do, whereas the \[Bonus\] one is a small improvement that we made for extra points. It adds several features, such as
* Being able to chose the density of pixels (Lower density allows you to improve greatly the computation time)
* Color palette choice
* Zooming and dezooming in the 2D plane

Depending on your computer capabilities, it might take some time to compute each fractal, which is why I recommend you use the Bonus version with low density of pixels.

Hope you like it, if you have any questions or comments feel free to send me a message.
